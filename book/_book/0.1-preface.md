This book is meant to serve as a comprehensive introduction to developing applications for the web using the Flask framework. By comprehensive, I don't mean verbose. I'm going to be direct and level with you here: I don't like reading huge word salads and I wouldn't want to subject anyone to that atrocity either. So I'm going to skip a lot of the fluff and babbling and just get down to the stuff. Now, this might not be your style. I'm totally cool with that. There are a ton of other resources available for our favorite framework. I encourage you to go out and explore them.

## Why Flask?
I'm not going to answer this question. People have done way better analysis of the various frameworks available than I ever could, or would want to. But I will say this: Flask will not limit you. The reason your application is slow, or doesn't scale properly, or has bugs or some other problem is not *because* you wrote it using Flask.

## Prerequisites
A working knowledge of Python, a working computer (which I assume you are viewing this on) running Windows, Mac or Linux, *some* googling skills and a desire to learn.

If you are not comfortable with Python, here are some resources that I like:

- Magnus Lie Hetland - Beginning Python
- Python documentation
- freecodecamp.org

## The Ideal Reader

The ideal reader of this book has some experience with Python, a basic understanding of how the web works, and wishes to develop applications for the web.

If you are a more advanced reader, feel free to skim through until you see something you find interesting (which is highly probable, mind you).  Also, for any suggestions, comments, or feedback, shoot me a mail at [feedback@flasktutorial.org](mailto:feedback@flasktutorial.org)
