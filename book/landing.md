(Yes, this is the cover of the book. Yes, I created it.)

## Learn Web Development with Flask

The [*Flask Tutorial*](/book/quick-start) book is meant to serve as a comprehensive introduction to [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), a lightweight web application framework written in [Python](https://www.python.org/). Flask is one of the most popular web frameworks today, used by [Netflix](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/automation-as-a-service-introducing-scriptflask-17a8e4ad954b), [Lyft](https://stackshare.io/lyft/lyft), [Reddit](https://stackshare.io/reddit/reddit), [Uber](https://stackshare.io/uber/partners-uber-com), [MIT](https://stackshare.io/mit/mit) and more. Flask is very lean and knows how to stay out of your way. This book is available for free online and will teach you how to develop and deploy enterprise-grade applications.

## Why this book?

When I was learning flask, I found a lack of correct, up-to-date and in-depth tutorials. This book is what I wish someone would have handed me the day I wrote my first application. *Flask Tutorial* is an ongoing project. Suggestions, comments and feedback is [welcome](mailto:feedback@flasktutorial.org). You can subscribe via email to receive updates.

## Thanks

Thanks to Flask community and the developers for creating such a beautiful and functional framework. Thanks to all the readers who have kindly provided their time and attention, despite this being not a professional, polished work. Thanks to all the those who have sent their [feedback](mailto:feedback@flasktutorial.org). I read everything I get.

 This site is hosted via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), my favorite static site builder.

I started learning Ruby on Rails in 2014. While I no longer use Ruby on Rails, [Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl](https://railstutorial.org/) was, and still is, one of my favorite books on the subject. It was available for free online back then. That's my inspiration for writing this book.
